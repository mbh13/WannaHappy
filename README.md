# WannaHappy
WannaHappy Open-Source Ransomware Blocker
**What does this tool do?**
This code is a project that I will update once a week. For now, I have shared the key required for the Solution of only 43 Ransomware openly with the tool, which allows you to decrypt these ransomware and get your data back. On the other hand, the control code I wrote using watchdog detects suspicious activities, blocks them or sends them to you. The Scanner scans the files you choose with the help of hashes for many types of viruses, including ransomware.
## Usage
```pip install pyfiglet```
```pip install watchdog```
```pip install colorama```
```pip install pycrypto```
```pip install pathlib```
```pip install psutil```
```python main.py```

## So prove it's true?
For this, we made a djvu ransomware that only encrypts the test directory it is in. There is absolutely no decryption tool that can solve it 100% of the time, but we give you an example: ```EXAMPLE-DJVU.py```
